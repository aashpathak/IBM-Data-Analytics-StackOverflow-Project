# IBM Data Analytics Capstone Project - Coursera

## Project Overview
This repository contains my final project for the **IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate** on Coursera.  
The goal was to **analyze historical stock and revenue data** and **build interactive dashboards** to visualize key insights.

It demonstrates the complete data analytics pipeline — from data collection and wrangling to visualization and dashboard design — using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly.
